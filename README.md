# Vanilla Typescript state management

This is a Typescript port for the original [ Beedle ](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/beedle) prototype. Additional resources by the author of the vanilla JS version can be found below:

This is the finished product of this [CSS-Tricks tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/build-a-state-management-system-with-vanilla-javascript). It's full of code comments so you can really dig in and learn too.

You can also see this in a [CodePen Project](https://codepen.io/hankchizljaw/project/editor/1f206d7807f492a111518b5d6692bb78).
